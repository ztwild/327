This is a totally wicked looking dagger. It's got awesome barbs on the back
of the blade, a compass on the hilt, and myriad other embelishments that
serve no functional purpose. You could totally be a deadly assassin with a
sweet blade like this. Since it's so light, it won't encumber you. It's
made out of polyurethane foam.

Shirley doesn't show up wearing the same thing again.
