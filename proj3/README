Run 'make' in the terminal. Then execute ./rlg327 to print a randomly generated dungeon.
user can also use the commands '--save' and/or '--load'. The program will first make sure
there are no more than three arguments. If there are more than 1, then it will check to
see if the commands are equal to the strings for load and save and toggle the
corresponding ints. Depending on what ints are toggled it will first load or create a new
dungeon, print the dungeon, then save the dungeon if specified. For the save/load dungeon functions in
load_save.c, they first call get_path to get the file path of its current directory and concatenates the
parent directory and file name of 'dungeon'.  Then save/load dungeon open the file as write/read
respectively. For the 32 bit values, they are converted to little endian for load, and big endian for
save.  Load returns the finished dungeon, save frees the manually allocated dungeon and quits.
