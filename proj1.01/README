When running main.c, it starts with creating a dungeon, then initializing 
the grid by setting the indices to the hardest value for a wall.  Then it randomly 
generates 3 rooms, their size and top left position. Then it flips a coin whether to 
add another room.  After all the rooms are made then it tries to place them on the grid, 
if any intersect, it starts over by creating new rooms. Once it has an assortment of rooms 
that satisfies the conditions, then it places the hallways in by finding a random spot in 
each of the rooms and randomly picks to extend the hallway in the x or y direction to get 
it closer to its destination.
