For this assignment, the main function starts with an empty array the size of 8.  
Each index in the array signifies the column of the board, and the value in the 
array is the row a queen is in that row.  This uses a recursion method, finding 
a position for a queen in the row of each column.  Before proceeding to the next 
column, the rec function has to validate the position of the new queen placed on 
the board.  The validation function checks if the previous queens are not in the 
same row or diagonal to the others.  It continues this process till the last 
column and then prints the result if valid.  Then backtracks through the stacks 
finding others placements that are a valid solution.
