Run 'make' in the terminal. Then execute ./rlg327 to print a randomly generated dungeon.
user can also use the commands '--save' and/or '--load'. The program will first make sure
ther are no more than three arguments. If there are more that 1, then it will check to 
see if the commands are equal to the strings for load and save and toggle the 
coresponding ints. Depending on what ints are toggled it will first load or create a new 
dungeon, print the dungeon, then save the dungeon if specified.
